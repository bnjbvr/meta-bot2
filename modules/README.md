# modules

These are the Trinity modules.

Need to be compiled with the
[`cargo-component`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component) tool, using `./build.sh`.

Right now, we're pinning the version of `cargo-component` we're using to a specific revision: use
`./install-cargo-component.sh` from this directory to get the right version.
